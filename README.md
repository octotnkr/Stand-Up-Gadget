# Stand-Up-Gadget

Working from home has become a popular concept. We enjoy the comfort of being in our own space and having the autonomy to complete our tasks in an environment that suits us. Being in our own comfortable spaces, we tend to zone out while doing our work and forget to take a break and move around.

The Stand-Up Gadget is a simple device that will prompt users that it's time to take a break. To utilize this device, the user simply sets the timer by hours or by minutes, with the push buttons. Once the time expires, there will be notified by a tone, blinking LED, and a message prompt. This then should prompt the user to take to turn it off and take a break. In order to turn off these notifications, they would have to simply press the reset button. This will also allow for the next use.
